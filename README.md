#### raz.hpp 

`raz.hpp` is an alternative to "stdio" for C++, it is mainly for programs written in very low-level C/C++
(programs where no library can be used because they are low-level, e.g.: OS, kernels, etc.)

It's fully optimized and improved (although it's still under development, which means it might have some bugs).

#### What does it bring?

 - Containers: `vector, array, map, queue, stack`
 - Smart types: `optional, pair`
 - String: all Utilities
 - I/O Sys: `cout, print, println, endl`
 - Algorithms: `sort, find, swap`
 - Math: `abs, pow, min and max`
 - Random: number generator
 - Utilities: `hash`

Similarly, you can read `DOC.txt` to find out what it includes, how to use it, and what it is used for.
